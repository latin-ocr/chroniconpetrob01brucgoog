some astonishment (itia) It is full of curious and profitable in-
formatiou. We cannot emnnerate all the litigations in which the
abbot was involved (a list of them will be found in the Index under
the head of Peterhorough), and will mention only one more. The
abbot established his exclusive right to hunt within his own domains,
and obtained a judgment by default against John Caurymaury and
several, other persons who were in the habit of running with their
dogs within the ahbot's liberties (pp. 135,138).

legal and constitutional history will be universally recognised. But
the Chroniole is not devoid even of passages of a higher general in-
terest. The transactione between Edward I. and the parliament
and convocation of the clergy upon the final conquest of Wales will
be found worthy of especial notice3 and particularly so the resolu-
tions of the latter body on the king’s “ petitions” to them for pe·
cuniary assistance at p. 59, and their list of grievances at p. 62.

Among events of perhaps minor historical moment, enantion may be

p. 26, and the account of the translation of the body of St Hugh at
p. 40. The translation was a very great occasion. Edward I. was
present with his queen and children, the archbishop of Canterbury,
seven bishops, and six ahbots A great multitude of people asssem·

and that hythe merits of the saint many miracles were performed on
that very occasion. ( ibid.)
