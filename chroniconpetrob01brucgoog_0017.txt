summoned the parties before his commissary·general in St. Maryle-
Bow. The intention of the abbot seems to heve been to weary out
the claimant with long-continued litigation. Papal provisions were
most unpopular, ond were no doubt often contested merely with the
view of ,putting the claimant to expense, and driving him to
relinquish bis provision.

The suits by the abbot himself are of many kinds, One is
against a refractory tenant of the abbey by knightservice, who
refused to pay his quota of a relief. On another occasion the
tenants of the abbey declined to perform their service exceptat

presentation of the church of Pokebroke (p. 77), and his very im·
portent right to the chattels of felons and fugitives within certain
hundreda (p. 119) An instructive account of the sums received
under this last head will be resd with interest, and probably with
